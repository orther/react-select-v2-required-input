# react-select-v2-required-input
Example workaround to get HTML5 required input validation working with react-select v2

The workaround in the `<FixRequiredSelect />` component used in this repo is based on [this](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/1827#issuecomment-409343434) GitHub comment with code example from @brunocramos which was based on @benkahle 's workaround.
